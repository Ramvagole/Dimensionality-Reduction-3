    "Change of Basis: Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are specific to the choice of basis or coordinate system. If you change the basis for your\n",

    "Eigen-decomposition, also known as eigendecomposition, plays a crucial role in various aspects of data analysis and machine learning.\n",
    "It provides valuable techniques for reducing the dimensionality of data, extracting meaningful patterns, and making predictions. Here are\n",
    "three specific applications or techniques in data analysis and machine learning that rely on eigen-decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\n",
    "Application: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in data analysis and machine learning. It's used to reduce the number\n",
    "of features in a dataset while retaining as much variance as possible. This is particularly useful for visualization, noise reduction, and \n",
    "speeding up machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technique: PCA relies on eigen-decomposition to find the principal components of a dataset. The principal components are the eigenvectors \n",
    "of the data's covariance matrix. These eigenvectors represent the directions in the data space where the data varies the most. \n",
    "By projecting the data onto a subset of these principal components, one can reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.\n",

    "Benefits: PCA simplifies data analysis by emphasizing the most significant features or dimensions in the data, making it easier to \n",
    "interpret and visualize data. It also helps in reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the efficiency of machine learning models.\n",

    "Spectral Clustering:\n",
    "Application: Spectral clustering is a powerful clustering technique used in data clustering, image segmentation, and community detection in \n",
    "networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technique: Spectral clustering leverages eigen-decomposition to transform data into a lower-dimensional space where clustering is performed.\n",
    "The process involves creating an affinity matrix to capture pairwise relationships between data points and then finding the eigenvectors \n",
    "(spectral embedding) associated with the top eigenvalues of this matrix. Clustering is performed in this lower-dimensional space.\n",
    "Benefits: Spectral clustering is effective in discovering complex, non-linear, and irregularly shaped clusters in data. It can outperform \n",
    "traditional clustering methods when data does not conform to spherical or isotropic shapes, making it suitable for a wide range of \n",
    "applications.\n",

    "Technique: Methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) rely on eigen-decomposition \n",
